# kafqa-assignment
This web-app is responsible for showing factorial of the input number.

#Invalid inputs
If you try to enter an invalid input, It will tell you that you have entered an invalid input please try again.

#Space managment
If you use space between numbers it will take remove space and take it as whole digit, I considered space must be an user typing error. So except throwing error 
it should give the desired result.

#Empty Space
If u left input empty of have blank space It will show an error message and you to try again.
